# Figment

## What is this?

Figment allows you to control precisely the lifetime of objects of any type. The
`fgmnt::figment` class is similar to `std::optional`, but it holds no
information about itself.

## Why the name?

> ‍Figments are subjective in that they are based on personal experiences and
> perceptions and may not be considered objective or verifiable by others.

The basis of Figment is that it's sometimes possible to deduce the state of an
object without verifying it. A figment shouldn't be used alongside boolean
flags. Any code that can access a figment should be unreachable under any unsafe
circumstances. Take for example a class instance: its member variables will
never be accessed again once the constructor throws. I bet you can come up with
other use cases.

## Is this safe? Like, at all?

As long as you don't make any mistakes. So definitely not! A figment is
fundamentally unsafe and instances should be used with care, and even then it's
very easy to fuck everything up. Don't use this library if value your sanity
over saving a few bytes.
